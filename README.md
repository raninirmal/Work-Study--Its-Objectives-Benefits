**1.	History of work study**

**FREDERICK W. TAYLOR**

 (1856-1915) He is known as the father of scientific management and industrial engineering. He is the first person to use a stopwatch to study work content and as such, the father of time study. Throughout his professional life, he worked as an apprentice machinist, time keeper expediter, lathe operator, gang boss, foreman of the machine shop and chief engineer.
Before Taylor, the work force developed own methods by trial and error. Taylor wanted management to reject an opinion for a more exact science.
 Specified the work method
•	Instructed the operator in that method
•	Maintained standard conditions for performing that work
•	Set time standard goals 
•	Paid premiums for doing the task as specified

**Work study is responsible for the following innovations**

•	Stopwatch time study

•	High-speed steel tools
•	Tool grinders

•	Slide rules

•	Functional type organization

**FRANK**

 (1868-1924) AND LILLIAN (1878-1972) GILBRETH They are known as the parents of motion/method study. Throughout their life time, they searched for the best method of doing a specific job and they developed many new techniques for studying work.
At the beginning of his work life as a bricklayers apprentice, Frank Gilbreth noticed that his instructor was using three different
set of motions when laying the bricks

•	One set of motions when he showed Frank how to
lay bricks

•	Another set of motions when he is working alone

•	Third set of motions when he is in a hurry

**THE WORK STUDY MAN**

•	Personal qualities
•have an inventive mind,be capable of devising simple mechanisms and devices which serve the purpose of saving time and effort, be able to gain the cooperation of engineers and technicians in developing such mechanisms, be good in human relations.

•	Sincerity and honesty,

•	Enthusiasm

•	Interest in and sympathy with people

•	Tact

•	Good appearance

•	Self confidence

**2 Introduction**

Productivity has now become an everyday watch word. It is crucial to the welfare of industrial firm as well as for the economic progress of the country. High productivity refers to doing the work in a shortest possible time with least expenditure on inputs without sacrificing quality and with minimum wastage of resources. Work-study forms the basis for work system design. The purpose of work design is to identify the most effective means of achieving necessary functions. 
This work-study aims at improving the existing and proposed ways of doing work and establishing standard times for work performance. Work-study is encompassed by two techniques, i.e., method study and work measurement

Work study is the systematic examination of the methods of carrying on activities so as to improve the effective use of resources and to set up standards of performance for the activities being carried out or Work study, as defined by British Standard Institution, is a generic term for those techniques particularly 
‘Method Study’ and ‘Work Measurement’ which are used in the examination of human work in all its contexts and which lead systematically to the investigation of all the factors which effect the efficiency of the situation being reviewed, in order to seek improvement

The time required to manufacture an item depends upon the manufacturing procedure; and one phase of work study known as Method study aims at finding the best possible manufacturing procedure which involves, least time and does not cause fatigue to the workers

“Method study is the systematic recording and critical examination of existing and proposed ways of doing work, as a means of developing and applying easier and more effective methods and reducing costs.” “Work measurement is the application or techniques designed to establish the time for a qualified worker to carry out a specified job at a defined level or performance.”
This is generally achieved by eliminating unnecessary motions involved in a certain procedure or by changing the sequence of operation or the process itself.

**PRODUCTIVITY**

Productivity is the quantitative relation between what we produce and we use as a resource to produce them, i.e., arithmetic ratio of amount produced (output) to the amount of resources (input). Productivity can be expressed as:

 Productivity = Output / Input
 
Productivity refers to the efficiency of the production system. It is the concept that guides the management of production system. It is an indicator to how well the factors of production (land, capital, labour and energy) are utilised. European Productivity Agency (EPA) has defined productivity as, “Productivity is an attitude of mind. 

It is the mentality of progress, of the constant improvements of that which exists. It is the certainty of being able to do better today than yesterday and continuously.

**Factors Influencing Productivity**

Factors influencing productivity can be classified broadly into two categories: (A) controllable (or internal) factors and (B) un-controllable (or external) factors.

**(A) CONTROLLABLE (OR INTERNAL) FACTORS** 

**1. Product factor**: 
In terms of productivity means the extent to which the product meets output requirements product is judged by its usefulness. The cost benefit factor of a product can be enhanced by increasing the benefit at the same cost or by reducing cost for the same benefit. 

**2. Plant and equipment:**
These play a prominent role in enhancing the productivity. The increased availability of the plant through proper maintenance and reduction of idle time increases the productivity. Productivity can be increased by paying proper attention to utilisation, age, modernisation, cost, investment etc

**Work Study (Time and motion study)****

**3. Technology:**

Innovative and latest technology improves productivity to a greater extent. Automation and information technology helps to achieve improvements in material handling, storage, communication system and quality control. The various aspects of technology factors to be considered are:

 (i) Size and capacity of the plant
 
 (ii) Timely supply and quality of inputs
 
 (iii) Production planning and control 
 
(iv) Repairs and maintenance

 (v) Waste reduction and 
 
(vi) Efficient material handling system

**4. Material and energy:**

Efforts to reduce materials and energy consumption brings about considerable improvement in productivity

1. Selection of quality material and right material.
 
 2. Control of wastage and scrap. 
 
3. Effective stock control. 

5. Development of sources of supply.
  
7. Optimum energy utilisation and energy savings.

 **5. Human factors**:
 
 Productivity is basically dependent upon human competence and skill. Ability to work effectively is governed by various factors such as education, training, experience aptitude etc., of the employees. Motivation of employees will influence productivity.
 
 **6. Work methods**:
 
 Improving the ways in which the work is done (methods) improves productivity, work study and industrial engineering techniques and training are the areas which improve the work methods, which in term enhances the productivity.
 
 **7. Management style:**
 
 This influence the organizational design, communication in organization, policy and procedures. A flexible and dynamic management style is a better approach to achieve higher productivity
 
**(B) UN-CONTROLLABLE (OR EXTERNAL) FACTORS **

**1. Structural adjustments:**

Structural adjustments include both economic and social changes. Economic changes that influence significantly are:
(a) Shift in employment from agriculture to manufacturing industry,

 (b) Import of technology, and 
 
(c) Industrial competitiveness. Social changes such as women’s participation in the labour force, education, cultural values, attitudes are some of the factors that play a significant role in the improvement of productivity.

 **2. Natural resources:**
 
 Manpower, land and raw materials are vital to the productivity improvement. 
 
**3. Government and infrastructure:**

Government policies and programmes are significant to productivity practices of government agencies, transport and communication power, fiscal policies (interest rates, taxes) influence productivity to the greater extent.
