**1.	History of work study**

**FREDERICK W. TAYLOR**

 (1856-1915) He is known as the father of scientific management and industrial engineering. He is the first person to use a stopwatch to study work content and as such, the father of time study. Throughout his professional life, he worked as an apprentice machinist, time keeper expediter, lathe operator, gang boss, foreman of the machine shop and chief engineer.
Before Taylor, the work force developed own methods by trial and error. Taylor wanted management to reject an opinion for a more exact science.

**2 Introduction**

Productivity has now become an everyday watch word. It is crucial to the welfare of industrial firm as well as for the economic progress of the country. High productivity refers to doing the work in a shortest possible time with least expenditure on inputs without sacrificing quality and with minimum wastage of resources. Work-study forms the basis for work system design. The purpose of work design is to identify the most effective means of achieving necessary functions. 
This work-study aims at improving the existing and proposed ways of doing work and establishing standard times for work performance. Work-study is encompassed by two techniques, i.e., method study and work measurement

Work study is the systematic examination of the methods of carrying on activities so as to improve the effective use of resources and to set up standards of performance for the activities being carried out or Work study, as defined by British Standard Institution, is a generic term for those techniques particularly 
‘Method Study’ and ‘Work Measurement’ which are used in the examination of human work in all its contexts and which lead systematically to the investigation of all the factors which effect the efficiency of the situation being reviewed, in order to seek improvement

The time required to manufacture an item depends upon the manufacturing procedure; and one phase of work study known as Method study aims at finding the best possible manufacturing procedure which involves, least time and does not cause fatigue to the workers

“Method study is the systematic recording and critical examination of existing and proposed ways of doing work, as a means of developing and applying easier and more effective methods and reducing costs.” “Work measurement is the application or techniques designed to establish the time for a qualified worker to carry out a specified job at a defined level or performance.”
This is generally achieved by eliminating unnecessary motions involved in a certain procedure or by changing the sequence of operation or the process itself.

**PRODUCTIVITY**

Productivity is the quantitative relation between what we produce and we use as a resource to produce them, i.e., arithmetic ratio of amount produced (output) to the amount of resources (input). Productivity can be expressed as:

 Productivity = Output / Input
 
Productivity refers to the efficiency of the production system. It is the concept that guides the management of production system. It is an indicator to how well the factors of production (land, capital, labour and energy) are utilised. European Productivity Agency (EPA) has defined productivity as, “Productivity is an attitude of mind. 

It is the mentality of progress, of the constant improvements of that which exists. It is the certainty of being able to do better today than yesterday and continuously.

**Factors Influencing Productivity**

Factors influencing productivity can be classified broadly into two categories: (A) controllable (or internal) factors and (B) un-controllable (or external) factors.

**(A) CONTROLLABLE (OR INTERNAL) FACTORS** 

**1. Product factor**: 
In terms of productivity means the extent to which the product meets output requirements product is judged by its usefulness. The cost benefit factor of a product can be enhanced by increasing the benefit at the same cost or by reducing cost for the same benefit. 

**2. Plant and equipment:**
These play a prominent role in enhancing the productivity. The increased availability of the plant through proper maintenance and reduction of idle time increases the productivity. Productivity can be increased by paying proper attention to utilisation, age, modernisation, cost, investment etc

**Work Study (Time and motion study)****

![Work Study (Time and motion study)](https://github.com/raninirmal/Work-Study--Its-Objectives-Benefits/assets/132740254/a2a7971d-a5f4-4f18-bad5-7b255a62c229)

**3. Technology:**

Innovative and latest technology improves productivity to a greater extent. Automation and information technology helps to achieve improvements in material handling, storage, communication system and quality control. The various aspects of technology factors to be considered are:

 (i) Size and capacity of the plant
 
 (ii) Timely supply and quality of inputs
 
 (iii) Production planning and control 
 
(iv) Repairs and maintenance

 (v) Waste reduction and 
 
(vi) Efficient material handling system

**4. Material and energy:**

Efforts to reduce materials and energy consumption brings about considerable improvement in productivity

1. Selection of quality material and right material.
 
 2. Control of wastage and scrap. 
 
3. Effective stock control. 

4. Development of sources of supply.
  
5. Optimum energy utilisation and energy savings.

 **5. Human factors**:
 
 Productivity is basically dependent upon human competence and skill. Ability to work effectively is governed by various factors such as education, training, experience aptitude etc., of the employees. Motivation of employees will influence productivity.
 
 **6. Work methods**:
 
 Improving the ways in which the work is done (methods) improves productivity, work study and industrial engineering techniques and training are the areas which improve the work methods, which in term enhances the productivity.
 
 **7. Management style:**
 
 This influence the organizational design, communication in organization, policy and procedures. A flexible and dynamic management style is a better approach to achieve higher productivity
 
**(B) UN-CONTROLLABLE (OR EXTERNAL) FACTORS **

**1. Structural adjustments:**

Structural adjustments include both economic and social changes. Economic changes that influence significantly are:
(a) Shift in employment from agriculture to manufacturing industry,

 (b) Import of technology, and 
 
(c) Industrial competitiveness. Social changes such as women’s participation in the labour force, education, cultural values, attitudes are some of the factors that play a significant role in the improvement of productivity.

 **2. Natural resources:**
 
 Manpower, land and raw materials are vital to the productivity improvement. 
 
**3. Government and infrastructure:**

Government policies and programmes are significant to productivity practices of government agencies, transport and communication power, fiscal policies (interest rates, taxes) influence productivity to the greater extent.

**Total Productivity Measure (TPM)**

It is based on all the inputs. The model can be applied to any manufacturing organization or service company.

** Total productivity = Total tangible output / Total trangible input**
 
Total tangible output = Value of finished goods produced + Value of partial units produced + Dividents from securities + Interest + Other income 

Total tangible input = Value of (human + material + capital + energy + other inputs) used. 
The word tangible here refers to measurable. 
The output of the firm as well as the inputs must be expressed in a common measurement unit. The best way is to express them in rupee value

**Productivity Improvement Techniques**

**(A) TECHNOLOGY BASED**

**1. Computer Aided Design (CAD),Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), and Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems (CIMS):**
CAD refers to design of products, processes or systems with the help of computers. 

 The impact of CAD on human productivity is significant for the advantages of CAD are: 

(a) Speed of evaluation of alternative designs

 (b) Minimisation of risk of functioning, and 
 
(c) Error reduction.

![CIMS](https://github.com/raninirmal/Work-Study--Its-Objectives-Benefits/assets/132740254/f718ca63-56eb-4c03-a51f-8ff44a5c5f6b)

CAM is very much useful to design and control the manufacturing. It helps to achieve the effectiveness in production system by line balancing.

(a) Production Planning and Control 

(b) Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP), Manufacturing Resources Planning (MRP II) and Materials Requirement Planning (MRP) 

(c) Automated Inspection

The relation between productivity and work study is thus obvious. If work study results in cutting down the time of performing a certain activity by 20 per cent, merely as a result of rearranging the sequence or simplifying the method of operation and without additional expenditure, then productivity will go up by a corresponding value, that is by 20 per cent. To appreciate how work study acts to cut down costs and reduce the time of a certain activity, it is necessary to examine more closely what that time consists of.
**1.	How the total time of a job is made up**

The time taken by a worker or a machine to carry out an operation or to produce a given quantity of a certain product may be considered as made up in the following manner
There is first: The basic work content of the product or operation2 Work content means, of course, the amount of work "contained in" a given product or a process measured in "work-hours" or "machine hours".

![Figure 2  How operational time is made up](https://github.com/raninirmal/Work-Study--Its-Objectives-Benefits/assets/132740254/10a61181-9b5d-42f1-9cee-6141df276ae3)

Figure 2. How operational time is made up
A work-hour is the labour of one person for one hour.
A machine-hour is the running of a machine or piece of plant for one hour. 
The basic work content is the time taken to manufacture the product or to perform the operation if the design or specification of the product or service provided were perfect, if the process or method of operation were perfectly carried out, and if there were no loss of working time from any cause whatsoever during the period of the operation (other than legitimate rest pauses permitted to the operative). 
The basic work content is the irreducible minimum time theoretically required to produce one unit of output.
 This is obviously a perfect condition which never occurs in practice, although it may sometimes be approached, especially in line manufacturing or process industries. In general, however, actual operation times are far in excess of it on account of:
excess work content

The work content is increased by the following

**A. Work content added by poor design or specification of product or its parts, or improper utilization of materi**als 

There are several ways in which unnecessary time and waste (resulting in higher cost of the product) can be attributed to poor design of the product or its parts, or to incorrect quality control

**A.l. Poor design and frequent design changes**

The product may be designed in such a way that it may require a large number of non-standard parts causing a lengthy time of assembly. Excessive variety of products and lack of standardization of products or their parts may mean that work has to be produced in small batches, with time lost as the operator adjusts and shifts from one batch to the next. 

**A.2. Waste of materials**

 The components of a product may be so designed that an excessive amount of material has to be removed to bring them to their final shape. This increases the work content of the job and wastes material as well. Operations requiring cutting in particular need careful examination to see if the resulting waste can be reduced to a minimum or reused. 


**A.3. Incorrect quality standards**

 Quality standards that are too high or too low can increase work content. In engineering industries, insisting on sometimes unnecessarily tight tolerances requires extra machining and a corresponding waste of material. On the other hand, setting tolerances too loose may result in a large number of rejects. Deciding on the appropriate quality standard and the method of quality control is an important efficiency consideration
B. Work content added by inefficient methods of manufacture or operation
Ineffective time and higher cost can result from a poor method of carrying out the operations, resulting in unnecessary movements of persons or materials.
B.l. Poor layout and utilization of space 
The space used for any operation represents an investment. Proper utilization of space is an important source of cost reduction, particularly when an enterprise is expanding and needs an increased working area. Furthermore, a proper layout reduces wasted movement, time and effort

**B.2. Inadequate materials handling **

Raw materials, parts and finished products are invariably being moved from one place to another throughout a production operation. The use of the most appropriate handling equipment for the purpose can save time and effort

**B.3. Frequent stoppages as production changes from one product to another**

 The proper planning and control of production operations can ensure that one production batch or order follows immediately on another so that idle time of machinery, equipment or labour is eliminated or minimized. 

**B.4. Ineffective method of work**

A sequence of operations may be well planned but each or some of them done in a cumbersome manner. By examining the way a certain operation is carried out and devising a better method, ineffective time can be reduced

**B.5. Poor planning of inventory**

 In every operation, raw material is usually ordered and stocked ahead of time and at every stage of the operation an inventory of so-called "materials-in-progress" or semi-finished products and various parts are temporarily stocked waiting to be processed. These various inventories represent a tied-up investment. A proper inventory control system when installed can minimize such an idle investment while ensuring that the operators do not run out of the material needed.
 
**B.6. Frequent breakdown of machines and equipment** 

Poor maintenance results in machinery and equipment that are often out of action, and idle time ensues while waiting for repairs. Installing a preventive maintenance system and mounting maintenance campaigns would ensure the smooth functioning of machinery and equipment.
****C. Work content resulting mainly from the contribution of human **

resources Workers in an enterprise can influence the time of operations voluntarily or involuntarily as follows:

**C.l. Absenteeism and lateness**

If management fails to provide a safe and satisfying work climate, workers could respond by absenteeism, lateness or deliberately working slowly

**C.2. Poor workmanship **

If workers are improperly trained, the resulting poor workmanship can mean that the job has to be done again. Losses may also occur because of wasted material.

**** C.3. Accidents and occupational hazards****

 If management fails to provide a safe and healthy place to work, accidents or occupational illnesses can occur, with resulting effects on morale and increased absenteeism. 
 
The impact of all the factors mentioned above under headings A to C is shown in figure 3. If these factors can be eliminated (an ideal situation which, of course, never occurs in real life), as shown in figure 4, the minimum time and cost for the production of a given output and hence the maximum productivity is achieved. It can therefore be seen that the work study specialist has to keep all these in mind when examining an operation and trying to develop an improved method. In Part Three we expand on these methods and techniques that can be used to reduce costs, cut ineffective time and develop a better method of work

**3. Need for Work Study:**

Principles of work study used to be employed even long ago, in order to explore improvements, when industry was simple and involved lesser problems; of course, a systematic procedure was not there. Today the industries with all their complexities and modernization naturally demand a more systematic approach like the work study in its present form

![Need of work study](https://github.com/raninirmal/Work-Study--Its-Objectives-Benefits/assets/132740254/574eb886-0b5f-4220-8041-b4dd29af4215)

Work study is a means of enhancing the production efficiency (productivity) of the firm by elimination of waste and unnecessary operations.

 It is a technique to identify non-value adding operations by investigation of all the factors affecting the job. It is the only accurate and systematic procedure-oriented technique to establish time standards.
 
 It is going to contribute to the profit as the savings will start immediately and continue throughout the life of the product. Method study and work measurement is part of work study.

**The human factor in the application of work study**

**1.	The human factor in enterprise operation**

The human factor is one of the most crucial elements in enterprise operations, for it is through people that management can control the utilization of its resources and the sale of its products or services. To give the best of their ability, employees must be motivated to do so. Managers must be able to provide a motive or a reason for doing something, or make people want to do it. 
It is of little use for management to prepare elaborate plans or give instructions for carrying out various activities if the people who are supposed to carry out the plans do not wish to do so — even though they may have to. The result would be half-hearted effort and sloppy workmanship. Coercion is no substitute for action that is taken voluntarily and willingly. Thus, employees at all levels must feel a sense of belonging to the enterprise; they should develop a sense of security, and the feeling that they are working in a safe, healthy and enriching working environment. 

When this happens they will contribute not only their labour but also many useful suggestions that can lead to productivity improvement, and assist willingly the work study person in developing improved methods of work. One of the greatest difficulties in obtaining the active cooperation of workers is the fear that raising productivity will lead to unemployment. Workers are afraid that they will work themselves out of their jobs. This anxiety is greatest when unemployment is already high and a worker who loses his or her job will find it hard to find another. Even in industrialized countries where the levels of unemployment are relatively lower than developing countries, this fear is very real to those who have already experienced unemployment. Since this is so, unless workers are assured of adequate assistance in facing their problems, 
they may resist any steps which they fear, rightly or wrongly, will make them redundant, even temporarily. 

**2. Work study and management**

It was said above that one of the principal reasons for choosing work study as the subject of this book is that it is a most penetrating tool of investigation. Because a well-conducted work study analysis is ruthlessly systematic, the places where effort and time are being wasted are laid bare one by one. In order to eliminate this waste, the causes of it must be looked for. 

The latter are usually found to be bad planning, bad organization, insufficient control or the lack of proper training. Since members of the management and supervisory staffs are employed to perform these functions, it will look as if they have failed in their duties. Not only this, but the increase in productivity which the proper use of work study usually brings about may appear to emphasize this failure further. 

Applying work study in one working area can start a chainreaction of investigation and improvement which will spread in all directions throughout the organization: to the plant engineer's department, the accounts department, the design office or the sales force.

 Skilled workers may be made to feel like novices when they find that their methods, long practised, are wasteful of time and effort, and that new workers trained in the new methods soon surpass them in output and quality. Any technique which has such far-reaching effects must obviously be handled with great care and tact. People do not like to be made to feel that they have failed, especially in the eyes of their superiors. They lose their self-confidence and begin to ask themselves whether they may not be replaced.
 
Their feeling of security is threatened. At first sight, this result of a work study investigation may seem unfair. Managers, supervisors and workers, generally speaking, are honest, hardworking people who do their jobs as well as they can. They are certainly not less clever than work study specialists.

Often they have years of experience and great practical knowledge. If they have failed to obtain the most from the resources at their disposal, it is generally because they have not been trained in, and often do not know the value of, the systematic approach which work study brings to problems of organization and performance of work.

If a course for management is to be run, however, the work study specialist must try as hard as possible to persuade the person at the top to attend and, if possible, to open the proceedings. Not only will this show everyone that he or she has the support of top management, but departmental and other managers will make efforts to attend if they think their "boss" is going to be there.

**2.	Work study and the supervisor**

The work study specialist's most difficult problem may often be the attitude of supervisors. They must be won over if he or she is to obtain good results from work study; indeed, their hostility may prevent him or her from doing any effective work at all. Supervisors represent management to the worker on the shop floor, and just as departmental managers will take their attitudes from the top manager, so the workers will take theirs from their supervisors. If it is evident that the supervisor thinks that "this work study stuff is nonsense", the workers will not respect the specialist and will make no efforts to carry out his or her suggestions, which, in any case, have to come to them through their supervisor.

Before the work study practitioner starts work, the whole purpose of work study and the procedures involved must be very carefully explained to the supervisor, so that he or she understands exactly what is being done and why. Unless this is done, the supervisor is likely to be difficult, if not actually obstructive, for many reasons. Among them are the following: 

(1) Supervisors are the people most deeply affected by work study. 
The work for which they may have been responsible for years is being challenged; if, through the application of work study methods, the efficiency of the operations for which they are responsible is greatly improved, they may feel that their prestige in the eyes of their superiors and of the workers will be lessened.

 (2) In most firms where specialists have not been used, the whole running of a certain operation — planning programmes of work, developing job methods, making up time sheets, setting piece rates, hiring and firing workers — may have been done by the supervisor. The mere fact that some of these responsibilities have been taken away is likely to make him or her experience a loss of status. No one likes to think that he or she has "lost face" or "lost ground".
 
 (3) If disputes arise or the workers are upset, supervisors are the first people who will be called upon to clear matters up, and it is difficult for them to do so fairly if they do not understand the problem.
 
**2.	Work study and the supervisor**

The work study specialist's most difficult problem may often be the attitude of supervisors. They must be won over if he or she is to obtain good results from work study; indeed, their hostility may prevent him or her from doing any effective work at all. Supervisors represent management to the worker on the shop floor, and just as departmental managers will take their attitudes from the top manager, so the workers will take theirs from their supervisors. If it is evident that the supervisor thinks that "this work study stuff is nonsense", the workers will not respect the specialist and will make no efforts to carry out his or her suggestions, which, in any case, have to come to them through their supervisor.

**3.	Work study and the worker**

When the first conscious attempts at work study were made at the turn of the century, little was known about the way people behaved at work. As a result, workers often resisted or were hostile to work study. During the past 40 years, however, a great deal of research has been carried out to discover more about the way people behave — the aim being not only to explain that behaviour but, if possible, also to predict how people will react to a new situation. For a work study specialist this is an important consideration, since through his or her interventions he or she is invariably and continuously creating new situations.

Behavioural scientists believe that individuals are motivated to act in a certain way by a desire to satisfy certain needs. One of the widely accepted notions about needs was developed by Abraham Maslow, who postulated that there are certain essential needs for every individual and that these needs arrange themselves in a hierarchical pattern. Maslow argues that it is only when one need becomes largely satisfied that the next need in the hierarchy will start to exert its motivating influence.

**4.	The work study practitioner**

We have talked a great deal in the preceding sections about what is required from the work study practitioner, suggesting by our requirements a human being who is almost too good to be true. The ideal person for the job is likely to be found very rarely, and if he or she is a successful work study specialist, can easily be promoted to higher posts. Nevertheless, there are certain qualifications and qualities which are essential for success

Education The very minimum standard of education for anyone who is to take charge of work study application in an enterprise is a good secondary education with matriculation or the equivalent school-leaving examination, or better still a university education, preferably in the engineering or business fields.

**Personal qualities**
Anyone who is going to undertake improvements in methods should have an inventive turn of mind, be capable of devising simple mechanisms and devices which can often save a great deal of time and effort, and be able to gain the cooperation of the engineers and technicians in developing them. The type of person who is good at this is not always so good at human relations, and in some large companies the methods section is separated from the work measurement section, although both could be under the same chief. The following are essential qualities:

**A. Sincerity and honesty**

 The work study person must be sincere and honest; only if this is the case will he or she gain the confidence and respect of those with whom he or she will work. 
 
**** B. Enthusiasm ****

He or she must be really keen on the job, believe in the importance of what he or she is doing and be able to transmit enthusiasm to the people round about. 

**C. Interest in and sympathy with people **

 The person must be able to get along with people at all levels. It is necessary to be interested in them, to be able to see their points of view and to understand the motives behind their behaviour. 
 
**D. Tact**

Tact in dealing with people comes from understanding them and not wishing to hurt their feelings by unkind or thoughtless words, even when these may be justified. Without tact no work study person is going to get very far. 
E. Good appearance  The person must be neat and tidy and look efficient. This will inspire confidence among the people with whom he or she has to work.

**F. Self-confidence**
This can only come with good training and experience of applying work study successfully. The work study practitioner must be able to stand up to top management, supervisors, trade union officials or workers in defence of his or her opinions and findings, and to do so in such a way that will win respect and not give offence. These personal qualities, particularly the ability to deal with people, can all be further developed with the right training. 

Far too often this aspect of the training of work study specialists is neglected, the assumption being that, if the right person is selected in the first place, that is all that needs to be done. In most work study courses more time should be given to the human side of applying work study

**7.Steps Involved in Work Study**

The steps of work study are:

![steps of work study](https://github.com/raninirmal/Work-Study--Its-Objectives-Benefits/assets/132740254/48b2c30d-148e-4799-8f04-6834a1dcaff2)

i.	Select -the job or process to be studied

ii.	Record or collect all relevant data about the job or process, using the most suitable data collection techniques (explained in Part Two), so that the data will be in the most convenient form to be analysed.

iii.	Examine the recorded facts critically and challenge everything that is done, considering in turn: the purpose of the activity; the place where it is performed; the sequence in which it is done; the person who is doing it; the means by which it is done.

iv.	Develop  the most economic method, taking into account all the circumstances and drawing as appropriate on various production management techniques (explained in Part Three), as well as on the contributions of managers, supervisors, workers and other specialists with whom new approaches should be explored and discussed. 

v.	Evaluate the results attained by the improved method compared with the quantity of work involved and calculate a standard time for it.

vi.	Define the new method and the related time and present it to all those concerned, either verbally or in writing, using demonstrations.

vii.	Install the new method, training those involved, as an agreed practice with the allotted time of operation

viii.	Maintain the new standard practice by monitoring the results and comparing them with the original targets 

**Techniques of Work Study**

**8.Method Study**

Method study enables the industrial engineer to subject each operation to systematic analysis. The main purpose of method study is to eliminate the unnecessary operations and to achieve the best method of performing the operation. Method study is also called methods engineering or work design. Method engineering is used to describe collection of analysis techniques which focus on improving the effectiveness of men and machines

Method study is the systematic recording and critical examination or existing and proposed ways or doing work as a means or developing and applying easier and more effective methods and reducing cost.”

In short, it is a systematic procedure to analyse the work to eliminate unnecessary operations.
It helps in reducing cost and unnecessary activity. In other words, it is a process of examining all the activities to find a simple way of doing it.

Fundamentally method study involves the breakdown of an operation or procedure into its component elements and their systematic analysis. In carrying out the method study, the right attitude of mind is important. The method study man should have: 

1. The desire and determination to produce results. 

2. Ability to achieve results.
  
3. An understanding of the human factors involved. 
 
Method study scope lies in improving work methods through process and operation analysis, such as

1. Manufacturing operations and their sequence. 
 
2. Workmen. 

3. Materials, tools and gauges.

4. Layout of physical facilities and work station design.
  
5. Movement of men and material handling.
  
6. Work environment. 

**9 Objectives of Method Study**

i.	It improves the proper utilisation of manpower, machine and materials

ii.	It also improves the factory layout, work place, etc

iii.	It also improves the process and procedure

xi.	Streamlined working procedures

**Scope of Method Study**

The scope of method study is not restricted to only manufacturing industries. Method study techniques can be applied effectively in service sector as well. It can be applied in offices, hospitals, banks and other service organizations. The areas to which method study can be applied successfully in manufacturing are:

1. To improve work methods and procedures.

2. To determine the best sequence of doing work.

3. To smoothen material flow with minimum of back tracking and to improve layout.
  
4. To improve the working conditions and hence to improve labour efficiency. 
 
5. To reduce monotony in the work. 
 
6. To improve plant utilisation and material utilisation. 

7. Elimination of waste and unproductive operations. 

8. To reduce the manufacturing costs through reducing cycle time of operations

**10 Steps of Method Study**

1.	 SELECT- the work to be studied and define its boundaries
	 
2.	RECORD - the relevant facts about the job by direct observation and collect such additional data as may be needed from appropriate sources. 
	
3.	EXAMINE - the way the job is being performed and challenge its purpose, place sequence and method of performance
	
4.	DEVELOP The most practical, economic and effective method, drawing on the contributions of those concerned

5.	EVALUATE - Different alternatives to developing a new improved method comparing the cost-effectiveness of the selected new method with the current method with the current method of performance

6. DEFINE -  The new method, as a result, in a clear manner and present it to those concerned, i.e., management, supervisors and workers
 
7. INSTALL - The new method as a standard practice and train the persons involved in applying it
 
8.MAINTAIN -  The new method and introduce control procedures to prevent a drifting back to the previous method of work.

Selection of the Job for Method Study
Cost is the main criteria for selection of a job, process and department for methods analysis. To carry out the method study, a job is selected such that the proposed method achieves one or more of the following results:

(a) Improvement in quality with lesser scrap.

(b) Increased production through better utilisation of resources. (c) Elimination of unnecessary operations and movements.

 (d) Improved layout leading to smooth flow of material and a balanced production line.
 
 (e) Improved working conditions.
 
**CONSIDERATIONS FOR SELECTION OF METHOD STUDY**

The job should be selected for the method study based upon the following considerations
1. Economic aspect
 
2. Technical aspect, and 
 
3. Human aspect.
 
**** A.	Economic Aspects ****

The method study involves cost and time. If sufficient returns are not attained, the whole exercise will go waste. Thus, the money spent should be justified by the savings from it. The following guidelines can be used for selecting a job:

	Bottleneck operations which are holding up other production operations. 
Operations involving excessive labour.

Operations producing lot of scrap or defectives. 

Operations having poor utilisation of resources

	Backtracking of materials and excessive movement of materials

**** B. Technical Aspects** **
 
The method study man should be careful enough to select a job in which he has the technical knowledge and expertise. A person selecting a job in his area of expertise is going to do full justice

Other factors which favour selection in technical aspect are
 1. Job having in consistent quality.
 
2. Operations generating lot of scraps.
  
3. Frequent complaints from workers regarding the job. 

**C. Human Considerations **

 Method study means a change as it is going to affect the way in which the job is done presently and is not fully accepted by workman and the union. Human considerations play a vital role in method study. These are some of the situations where human aspect should be given due importance:
 
5.	Workers complaining about unnecessary and tiring work

7.	More frequency of accidents.
	
8.	 Inconsistent earning.
 
**Recording Techniques for Method Study**

The next step in basic procedure, after selecting the work to be studied is to record all facts relating to the existing method. In order that the activities selected for investigation may be visualised in their entirety and in order to improve them through subsequent critical examination, it is essential to have some means of placing on record all the necessary facts about the existing method. Records are very much useful to make before and after comparison to assess the effectiveness of the proposed improved method. The recording techniques are designed to simplify and standardise the recording work. For this purpose charts and diagrams are used.

![record method](https://github.com/raninirmal/Work-Study--Its-Objectives-Benefits/assets/132740254/44f6f526-64f3-49be-9a83-fba564aec644)

**CHARTS USED IN METHODS STUDY**

This is the most popular method of recording the facts. The activities comprising the jobs are recorded using method study symbols. A great care is to be taken in preparing the charts so that the information it shows is easily understood and recognized. The following information should be given in the chart. These charts are used to measure the movement of operator or work (i.e., in motion study).

 (a) Adequate description of the activities.
 
 (b) Whether the charting is for present or proposed method.
 
 (c) Specific reference to when the activities will begin and end. 
 
(d) Time and distance scales used wherever necessary.

 (e) The date of charting and the name of the person who does charting.
Types of Charts

It can be broadly divided into 
(A) Macro motion charts and

 (B) Micro motion charts. Macro motion charts are used for macro motion study and micro motion charts are used for micro motion study.
 
Macro motion study is one which can be measured through ‘stop watch’ and micro motion study is one which cannot be measured through stop watch.

(A) MACRO MOTION CHARTS
Following four charts are used under this type: 

**1. Operation Process Chart**
- It is also called outline process chart. An operation process chart gives the bird’s eye view of the whole process by recording only the major activities and inspections involved in the process. Operation process chart uses only two symbols, i.e., operation and inspection. Operation, process chart is helpful to: (a) Visualise the complete sequence of the operations and inspections in the process. (b) Know where the operation selected for detailed study fits into the entire process. (c) In operation process chart, the graphic representation of the points at which materials are introduced into the process and what operations and inspections are carried on them are shown. 
- 
**2.	Flow Process Chart Flow** 

process chart gives the sequence of flow of work of a product or any part of it through the work centre or the department recording the events using appropriate symbols. It is the amplification of the operation process chart in which operations; inspection, storage, delay and transportation are represented. However, process charts are of three types: 

(a) Material type—Which shows the events that occur to the materials. 

(b) Man type—Activities performed by the man.

 (c) Equipment type—How equipment is used.
 
The flow process chart is useful:

(a) to reduce the distance travelled by men (or materials).

 (b) to avoid waiting time and unnecessary delays
 
(c) to reduce the cycle time by combining or eliminating operations.

 (d) to fix up the sequence of operations
 
(e) to relocate the inspection stages.

Like operation process chart, flow process chart is constructed by placing symbols one below another as per the occurrence of the activities and are joined by a vertical line. 
A brief description of the activity is written on the right hand side of the activity symbol and time or distance is given on the left hand side.

**3.	Two Handed Process Chart******

A two handed (operator process chart) is the most detailed type of flow chart in which the activities of the workers hands are recorded in relation to one another. 
The two-handed process chart is normally confined to work carried out at a single workplace. 
This also gives synchronised and graphical representation of the sequence of manual activities of the worker. The application of this charts are
•	To visualise the complete sequence of activities in a repetitive task. 
•	To study the work station layout.

**4.	Multiple Activity Chart**

It is a chart where activities of more than subject (worker or equipment) are each recorded on a common time scale to show their inter-relationship. Multiple activity chart is made:

  To study idle time of the man and machines, 
  
 To determine number of machines handled by one operator, and 
 
 To determine number of operators required in teamwork to perform the given job.
 
**5.	Diagrams Used in Method Study**
The flow process chart shows the sequence and nature of movement but it does not clearly show the path of movements. In the paths of movements, there are often undesirable features such as congestion, back tracking and unnecessary long movements. To record these unnecessary features, representation of the working area in the form of flow diagrams, string diagrams can be made

1 To study the different layout plans and thereby; select the most optimal layout. 

2. To study traffic and frequency over different routes of the plant.
 
3. Identification of back tracking and obstacles during movements. Diagrams are of two types
 
1. Flow diagram and
2. String diagram
3. 
**1. FLOW DIAGRAM **

Flow diagram is a drawing, of the working area, showing the location of the various activities identified by their numbered symbols and are associated with particular flow process chart either man type or machine type. The routes followed in transport are shown by joining the symbols in sequence by a line which represents as nearly as possible the path or movement of the subject concerned. Following are the procedures to make the flow diagram

 1 The layout of the workplace is drawn to scale.
 
 2. Relative positions of the machine tools, work benches, storage, and inspection benches are marked on the scale. 
  
3. Path followed by the subject under study is tracked by drawing lines
 
3. Each movement is serially numbered and indicated by arrow for direction. 

4. Different colours are used to denote different types of movements.
 
5. STRING DIAGRAM

The string diagram is a scale layout drawing on which, length of a string is used to record the extent as well as the pattern of movement of a worker working within a limited area during a certain period of time. The primary function of a string diagram is to produce a record of a existing set of conditions so that the job of seeing what is actually taking place is made as simple as possible. One of the most valuable features of the string diagram is the actual distance travelled during the period of study to be calculated by relating the length of the thread used to the scale of drawing. Thus, it helps to make a very effective comparison between different layouts or methods of doing job in terms of the travelling involved.

 The main advantages of string diagram compared to flow diagram is that respective movements between work stations which are difficult to be traced on the flow diagram can be conveniently shown on string diagram.
 
Following are the procedures to draw string diagram: 

1. A layout of the work place of factory is drawn to scale on the soft board. 
 
2. Pins are fixed into boards to mark the locations of work stations, pins are also driven at the turning points of the routes.
  
3. A measured length of the thread is taken to trace the movements (path).

 4. The distance covered by the object is obtained by measuring the remaining part of the thread and subtracting it from original length
 5. 
** Symbols Used in Method Study**
** 1.Operation ** 
         
         ![0](https://github.com/raninirmal/Work-Study--Its-Objectives-Benefits/assets/132740254/a0574aa0-4fc2-4a1e-b459-a369191f1918)
         
An operation occurs when an object is intentionally changed in one or more of its characteristics (physical or chemical). This indicates the main steps in a process, method or procedure. 
An operation always takes the object one stage ahead towards completion. Examples of operation are:

•	Turning, drilling, milling, etc.

•	A chemical reaction. 

•	Welding, brazing and riveting.

•	Lifting, loading, unloading

•	Getting instructions from supervisor.

•	Taking dictation

**2 Inspection**

An inspection occurs when  object is examined and compared with standard for quality and quantity. The inspection examples are:

•	  Visual observations for finish.

•	  Count of quantity of incoming material

•	 Checking the dimension

**3 Transport**

A transport indicates the movement of workers, materials or equipment from one place to another. 
Example: Movement of materials from one work station to another. Workers travelling to bring tools

![Arrow](https://github.com/raninirmal/Work-Study--Its-Objectives-Benefits/assets/132740254/2b9c5abe-ed23-4ee7-8ec9-c43c50eb3d3e)

**4. Temporary storage or Delay  **    

A delay occurs when the immediate performance of the next planned thing does not take place.
 Example: Work waiting between consecutive operations. Workers waiting at tool cribs. 
Operators waiting for instructions from supervisor.

**MOTION STUDY**

Motion study is part of method study where analysis of the motion of an operator or work will be studied by following the prescribed methods.

**Principles of Motion study**

There are a number of principles concerning the economy of movements which have been developed as a result of experience and which forms the basis for the development of improved methods at the workplace. 
These are first used by Frank Gilbreth, the founder of motion study and further rearranged and amplified by Barnes, Maynard and others. The principles are grouped into three headings:

 (a) Use of the human body.
 
(b) Arrangement of workplace.

(c) Design of tools and equipment

**(A) USES OF HUMAN BODY When possible:**
1. The two hands should begin and complete their movements at the same time. 
2.The two hands should not be idle at the same time except during periods of rest. 
3.Motions of the arms should be made simultaneously. 
4.Hand and body motions should be made at the lowest classification at which it is possible to do the work satisfactorily. 
5.Momentum should be employed to help the worker, but should be reduced to a minimum whenever it has to be overcome by muscular effort. 
6. Continuous curved movements are to be preferred to straight line motions involving sudden and changes in directions. 
7. Ballistic’ (i.e., free swinging) movements are faster, easier and more accurate than restricted or controlled movements
8. Rhythm is essential to the smooth and automatic performance of a repetitive operation. The work should be arranged to permit easy and natural rhythm wherever possible.
 9. Work should be arranged so that eye movements are confined to a comfortable area, without the need for frequent changes of focus.
**(B) ARRANGEMENT OF THE WORKPLACE**
1. Definite and fixed stations should be provided for all tools and materials to permit habit formation.
 
2. Tools and materials should be pre-positioned to reduce searching.
 
3. Gravity fed, bins and containers should be used to deliver the materials as close to the point of use as possible.

4. Tools, materials and controls should be located within a maximum working area and as near to the worker as possible. 
 
5. Materials and tools should be arranged to permit the best sequence of motions. 

6. ‘Drop deliveries’ or ejectors should be used wherever possible, so that the operative does not have to use his hands to dispose of finished parts.

 7. Provision should be made for adequate lightning, and a chair of type and height to permit good posture should be provided. 
 
**(C) DESIGN OF TOOLS AND EQUIPMENTS**

1. The colour of the workplace should contrast with that of work and thus reduce eye fatigue.
 
2. The hands should be relieved of all work of ‘holding’ the work piece where this can be done by a jig or fixture or foot operated device.
3. Two or more tools should be combined where possible.
   
4. Where each finger performs some specific movement, as in typewriting, the load should be distributed in accordance with the inherent capacities of the fingers.

 5. Handles such as those used on screw drivers and cranks should be designed to permit maximum surface of the hand to come in contact with the handle. 

6. Levers, cross bars and wheel bars should be in such position that operator can manipulate them with least body change and with greatest mechanical advantage.

**Recording Techniques of Motion Study**

Most of the techniques mentioned in method study is used in the motion study. They are as follows:

**1. Macro Motion Study **

(a) Flow process chart
(b) Two handed process chart

**2. Micro Motion Study**

SIMO chart.

**Steps involved in Motion Analysis are:**

(a) Select the operation to be studied.

(b) List and chart various motions performed by the operator.

(c) Identify the productive and idle motions.

(d) Eliminate the unnecessary and non-productive motions.

(e) Redesign the existing operating procedure by employing minimum number of motions in the most appropriate sequence and in accordance with the principles of motion economy.

(f) Impart necessary instructions to the worker so that he develops proper habit cycle.

(g) Check once again the procedure in the light of step (e) above.

(h) The procedure may be standardized


**11.Work Measurement**

Work measurement is also called by the name ‘time study’. Work measurement is absolutely essential for both the planning and control of operations. 
Without measurement data, we cannot determine the capacity of facilities or it is not possible to quote delivery dates or costs.

 We are not in a position to determine the rate of production and also labour utilisation and efficiency. It may not be possible to introduce incentive schemes and standard costs for budget control.
 
It involves methods and tools used to analyse the time in which work is executed. It includes examination and developing the standard time in which the work will get completed.
 Standard time is the time taken by the well-trained workforce to produce one unit 
 
 ![diff](https://github.com/raninirmal/Work-Study--Its-Objectives-Benefits/assets/132740254/527a41c9-be9a-4db4-a29c-2cbe11e62e2c)

**12 Work Measurement objectives**

i.	Determines the time required to do a job; thus, it compares alternative methods and establishes the fastest method.

ii.	Decides man power required for a job; it helps in man power economy.

iii.	Decides equipment requirement.

iv.	Provides information for effective production planning and maintenance procedures;

v.	Aids in calculating exact delivery dates.

vi.	Decides realistic labour budgeting and provides a basis for standard costing syste.

vii.	Provides a basis for fair and sound incentive schemes and

viii.	Results in effective labour control.

ix.	Cost reduction and cost control

x.	Identifying substandard workers

xi.	Training new employees

**Why is Work Measurement Important?**

The purpose of the work measurement method is to cover all the work to be measured.
Work measurement involves estimating the amount of human effort required to produce a unit of output.
Work measurement refers to measuring the volume of work completed and the time it took to complete it.

**Here are five reasons why you should measure your work:**

**1. Enables your growth and development:**

Measurement and management of employee performance are important since they allow businesses to determine how efficient workers are.
The measurement of work by itself will not enable growth. It can, however, be combined with continuous feedback to enable employees to self-assess and improve their skills.

**2. Ensure alignment of goals and growth of the company**
Employee performance measurement can determine those goals by identifying areas where someone is doing well and could be stretched and areas where they are not yet strong.

3. Better understand your company’s performance.
Your company’s performance can be predicted by knowing how well you perform through work measurement.

4. Create a fair culture of recognition

Equal treatment of employees is ensured by work measurement. Employees who are good performers and those who are procrastinators are distinguished, which creates a fair recognition culture. 

5. Identifying and eliminating wasted or ineffective time.

Work measurement eliminates wasted or ineffective time. Measuring work is concerned with reducing and ultimately removing unproductive time, i.e., a time when no effective work is being done. 
Techniques of Work Measurement

**For the purpose of work measurement,** work can be regarded as:
 1. Repetitive work:
  
 2 The type of work in which the main operation or group of operations repeat continuously during the time spent at the job. These apply to work cycles of extremely short duration.
 
 3. non-repetitive work
 
 4. : It includes some type of maintenance and construction work, where the work cycle itself is hardly ever repeated identically. 

Various techniques of work measurement are: 
1. Time study (stop watch technique), 

2. Synthesis,
  
3. Work sampling,
 
4. Predetermined motion and time study
 
5 Analytical estimating

![Various techniques of work measurement](https://github.com/raninirmal/Work-Study--Its-Objectives-Benefits/assets/132740254/1ca61fd3-9803-4c3e-b82c-401d586d6ae5)

Time study and work sampling involve direct observation and the remaining are data based and analytical in nature.

 1. Time study: A work measurement technique for recording the times and rates of working for the elements of a specified job carried out under specified conditions and for analysing the data so as to determine the time necessary for carrying out the job at the defined level of performance. In other words measuring the time through stop watch is called time study
 
2. Synthetic data: A work measurement technique for building up the time for a job or pans of the job at a defined level of performance by totalling element times obtained previously from time studies on other jobs containing the elements concerned or from synthetic data.
  
 3. Work sampling: A technique in which a large number of observations are made over a period of time of one or group of machines, processes or workers. Each observation records what is happening at that instant and the percentage of observations recorded for a particular activity, or delay, is a measure of the percentage of time during which that activities delay occurs.
 
 4. Predetermined motion time study (PMTS): A work measurement technique whereby times established for basic human motions (classified according to the nature of the motion and conditions under which it is made) are used to build up the time for a job at the defined level of performance. The most commonly used PMTS is known as Methods Time Measurement (MTM).
 
5. Analytical estimating: A work measurement technique, being a development of estimating, whereby the time required to carry out elements of a job at a defined level of performance is estimated partly from knowledge and practical experience of the elements concerned and partly from synthetic data


![tecnhiques](https://github.com/raninirmal/Work-Study--Its-Objectives-Benefits/assets/132740254/45d36fc9-e5ee-4039-aa93-84ebcf53788f)

**Steps Involved in Work Measuremen**t

Work measurement involves analyzing the size of a task, its method of performance, and production efficiency.

1.	Decompose the job into its components.
	
2.	Measure the elapsed time on the various elements using either time studies, synthesis, analytical estimation, or other methods.
	
3.To set up elemental time values, take the observed time and convert it into normal time using the rating factor.
	
4.	Evaluate the amount of relaxation, physical and mental exhaustion involved in carrying out each element.

5.	Count the time allotted for relaxation when arriving at the work content for each element.
	
6.	Identify the number of times each element occurs in the job, multiply each element’s work content by its frequency (i.e., how often it appears in the position), and add all the times together.

7.	Contingency allowances should be added if necessary to arrive at the standard time to complete the work.
Measurement of work helps estimate labor costs. Moreover, it provides information on the estimation of tenders, the assessment of delivery schedules, and the fixing of selling prices

**TIME STUDY **

Time study is also called work measurement. It is essential for both planning and control of operations. According to British Standard Institute time study has been defined as “The application of techniques designed to establish the time for a qualified worker to carry out a specified job at a defined level of performance

Steps in Making Time study

Stop watch time is the basic technique for determining accurate time standards. They are economical for repetitive type of work. Steps in taking the time study are: 

1. Select the work to be studied.
 
3. Obtain and record all the information available about the job, the operator and the working conditions likely to affect the time study work. 
4. Breakdown the operation into elements. An element is a instinct part of a specified activity composed of one or more fundamental motions selected for convenience of observation and timing. 
5. Measure the time by means of a stop watch taken by the operator to perform each element of the operation. Either continuous method or snap back method of timing could be used. 
6. At the same time, assess the operators effective speed of work relative to the observer’s concept of ‘normal’ speed. This is called performance rating.
 6. Adjust the observed time by rating factor to obtain normal time for each element Normal Observed time Rating 100 = × 
7. Add the suitable allowances to compensate for fatigue, personal needs, contingencies. etc. to give standard time for each element.
 8. Compute allowed time for the entire job by adding elemental standard times considering frequency of occurrence of each element. 
9. Make a detailed job description describing the method for which the standard time is established. 10. Test and review standards wherever necessary.

**Computation of Standard Time**

Standard time is the time allowed to an operator to carry out the specified task under specified conditions and defined level of performance. 
The various allowances are added to the normal time as applicable to get the standard time as shown in Fig. 7.6. Standard time may be defined as the, amount of time required to complete a unit of work: 
(a) under existing working conditions,
 (b) using the specified method and machinery
(c) by an operator, able to the work in a proper manner, and 
(d) at a standard pace.
Thus basic constituents of standard time are: 

1. Elemental (observed time).
 
2. Performance rating to compensate for difference in pace of working. 
 
3. Relaxation allowance.

4. Interference and contingency allowance. 
  
5. Policy allowance
6.

OT – Observed Time

 PRF – Performance Rating Factor
 
 NT – Normal Time 
 
PA – Process Allowances 

RPA – Rest and Personal Allowances SA – Special Allowances 

PoA – Policy Allowances

**Allowances **

The normal time for an operation does not contain any allowances for the worker. It is impossible to work throughout the day even though the most practicable, effective method has been developed.
 
Even under the best working method situation, the job will still demand the expenditure of human effort and some allowance must therefore be made for recovery from fatigue and for relaxation. Allowances must also be made to enable the worker to attend to his personal needs. The allowances are categorised as:

(1) Relaxation allowance, 

(2) Interference allowance, and 

(3) Contingency allowance

**1.	RELAXATION ALLOWANCE **

Relaxation allowances are calculated so as to allow the worker to recover from fatigue. 
Relaxation allowance is a addition to the basic time intended to provide the worker with the opportunity to recover from the physiological and psychological effects of carrying out specified work under specified conditions and to allow attention to personal needs. The amount of allowance will depend on nature of the job. Relaxation allowances are of two types: fixed allowances and variable allowances. Fixed allowances constitute: 

**(a)	Personal needs allowance**:
It is intended to compensate the operator for the time necessary to leave, the workplace to attend to personal needs like drinking water, smoking, washing hands. Women require longer personal allowance than men. A fair personal allowance is 5% for men, and 7% for women. 

**(b)	Allowances for basic fatigue: **

This allowance is given to compensate for energy expended during working. A common figure considered as allowance is 4% of the basic time.

**2.	VARIABLE ALLOWANCE**

Variable allowance is allowed to an operator who is working under poor environmental conditions that cannot be improved, added stress and strain in performing the job. The variable fatigue allowance is added to the fixed allowance to an operator who is engaged on medium and heavy work and working under abnormal conditions. The amount of variable fatigue allowance varies from organization to organization.

**3.	INTERFERENCE ALLOWANCE **

It is an allowance of time included into the work content of the job to compensate the operator for the unavoidable loss of production due to simultaneous stoppage of two or more machines being operated by him.
This allowance is applicable for machine or process controlled jobs
Interference allowance varies in proportion to number of machines assigned to the operator. 
The interference of the machine increases the work content.

**4.	CONTINGENCY ALLOWANCE**
	
 A contingency allowance is a small allowance of time which may be included in a standard time to meet legitimate and expected items of work or delays. 
The precise measurement of which is uneconomical because of their infrequent or irregular occurrence. This allowance provides for small unavoidable delays as well as for occasional minor extra work: Some of the examples calling for contingency allowance are:

  Tool breakage involving removal of tool from the holder and all other activities to insert new tool into the tool holder. 
 Power failures of small duration.
  Obtaining the necessary tools and gauges from central tool store. Contingency allowance should not exceed 5%
  
**5.	POLICY ALLOWANCE** 

Policy allowances are not the genuine part of the time study and should be used with utmost care and only in clearly defined circumstances. 
The usual reason for making the policy allowance is to line up standard times with requirements of wage agreement between employers and trade unions. The policy allowance is an increment, other than bonus increment, applied to a standard time (or to some constituent part of it, e.g., work content) to provide a satisfactory level of earnings for a specified level of performance under exceptional circumstances. Policy allowances are sometimes made as imperfect functioning of a division or part of a plant.

**13 Benefits of Work Measurement** 

Organizations determine whether work programs, investments, and acquisitions achieve their objectives in work measurement.

A good work measurement system has the following benefits. 
•	A better understanding of work measurements enables better control over work methods and processes.

•	Evaluate the suitableness of the workforce assigned to an organization.

•	A good management system reduces labor costs, increases productivity, and improves performance appraisal, planning, and scheduling.

•	Work measurement enables the development of realistic work schedules through an accurate assessment of human work compared to plant capacity for production and maintenance planning. 

•	Detailed instructions are provided on how to prepare estimated selling prices and delivery schedules for tenders.

•	The effectiveness of work planning can be determined.

•	Prevents backlogs of work.

•	Streamline work processes. 

•	Simplifies workforce planning through an analysis of actual and standard time.

•	The cost and labor requirements of the future can be estimated. The purpose of this is to provide a framework for estimating and controlling labor costs.
