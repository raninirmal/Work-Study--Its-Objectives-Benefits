**1.	History of work study**

**FREDERICK W. TAYLOR**

 (1856-1915) He is known as the father of scientific management and industrial engineering. He is the first person to use a stopwatch to study work content and as such, the father of time study. Throughout his professional life, he worked as an apprentice machinist, time keeper expediter, lathe operator, gang boss, foreman of the machine shop and chief engineer.
Before Taylor, the work force developed own methods by trial and error. Taylor wanted management to reject an opinion for a more exact science.
 Specified the work method
•	Instructed the operator in that method
•	Maintained standard conditions for performing that work
•	Set time standard goals 
•	Paid premiums for doing the task as specified

**Work study is responsible for the following innovations**

•	Stopwatch time study

•	High-speed steel tools
•	Tool grinders

•	Slide rules

•	Functional type organization

**FRANK**

 (1868-1924) AND LILLIAN (1878-1972) GILBRETH They are known as the parents of motion/method study. Throughout their life time, they searched for the best method of doing a specific job and they developed many new techniques for studying work.
At the beginning of his work life as a bricklayers apprentice, Frank Gilbreth noticed that his instructor was using three different
set of motions when laying the bricks

•	One set of motions when he showed Frank how to
lay bricks

•	Another set of motions when he is working alone

•	Third set of motions when he is in a hurry

**THE WORK STUDY MAN**

•	Personal qualities
•have an inventive mind,be capable of devising simple mechanisms and devices which serve the purpose of saving time and effort, be able to gain the cooperation of engineers and technicians in developing such mechanisms, be good in human relations.

•	Sincerity and honesty,

•	Enthusiasm

•	Interest in and sympathy with people

•	Tact

•	Good appearance

•	Self confidence

**2 Introduction**

Productivity has now become an everyday watch word. It is crucial to the welfare of industrial firm as well as for the economic progress of the country. High productivity refers to doing the work in a shortest possible time with least expenditure on inputs without sacrificing quality and with minimum wastage of resources. Work-study forms the basis for work system design. The purpose of work design is to identify the most effective means of achieving necessary functions. 
This work-study aims at improving the existing and proposed ways of doing work and establishing standard times for work performance. Work-study is encompassed by two techniques, i.e., method study and work measurement

Work study is the systematic examination of the methods of carrying on activities so as to improve the effective use of resources and to set up standards of performance for the activities being carried out or Work study, as defined by British Standard Institution, is a generic term for those techniques particularly ‘Method Study’ and ‘Work Measurement’ which are used in the examination of human work in all its contexts and which lead systematically to the investigation of all the factors which effect the efficiency of the situation being reviewed, in order to seek improvement

The time required to manufacture an item depends upon the manufacturing procedure; and one phase of work study known as Method study aims at finding the best possible manufacturing procedure which involves, least time and does not cause fatigue to the workers
“Method study is the systematic recording and critical examination of existing and proposed ways of doing work, as a means of developing and applying easier and more effective methods and reducing costs.” “Work measurement is the application or techniques designed to establish the time for a qualified worker to carry out a specified job at a defined level or performance.”
This is generally achieved by eliminating unnecessary motions involved in a certain procedure or by changing the sequence of operation or the process itself.
